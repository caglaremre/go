 - use ==var== to define a variable.
 - write a type **after** the variable name to define variable type. exp: `var example string`
 - use ==:\=== assign return of a function to a variable. exp: `example := doSomething()`
 - you can have a not used variable in package but not in the functions.
 - you can return more than one variable.
 - use pointers to associate funcs to structs `func (m *myStruct) doSomething() string {}`
